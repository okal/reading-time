Reading Time for Chrome
=======================

Reading Time for Chrome lets you know how long it will take to read a post before
you click through. The data comes from [Samrat Man Singh] (http://samrat.me)'s Reading Time
API. Simply right click on a link and select "How long will this take?".

Installation
============

I don't have a Chrome extension developer's account, so you have to install
this manually.

1. Click the wrench icon at the top right corner of the browser window.
2. Go to Tools > Extensions
3. Check "Developer Mode"
4. Download this repository and unzip it.
5. Click the "Load unpacked extension" button and browse to the unzipped directory.
6. Select the folder.
7. ???
8. Profit?

NB: You will need to reload any previously opened pages for the extension to take
effect on them.
